For ideas on where to visit in Turkey, check out the [TourIstanbul](https://www.turkishairlines.com/en-int/flights/fly-different/touristanbul/) website. The website is for people __on layovers only__ but there's a wonder list of all the things to do in Istanbul. It serves as a perfect starting off point and many of the options on the site will be documented below.

## Landing in Turkey
Sometimes the plane lands outside and you walk down stairs to the tarmac and catch a bus to the airport. Try to be the last people on the most full bus (this will be the first bus to leave), it's hard to judge. I suggest this because immigration lines can take a long times. Other times, it's like normal, there's a walkway connected directly to the plane.

Right outside the airport are buses that go to major parts of the city also make note of the . You can board the bus for the price listed on the screen. I boarded the bus heading to Kadikoy, Bus 14, it was the last stop on that route. Make note of the stops on the route like any other bus system. From the bus stop, a taxi can be taken to the place you're staying at. This is significantly more cheaper than taking a taxi from the airport. At the time of writing this, the price of the ticket to Kadikoy or any of its stops is $150 Lira or about $5USD per person. I've been told there's a limit of 1 bag person but I checked in two bags. 

The checking in process is simple. It's just like when you go to some grocery stores. If you come into the store with a bag, you give the clerk your bad and they give you a numbered ticket/tag in exchange. When you leave, you give the numbered ticket/tag back and the the clerk returns your bag. The bag check-in process is the same. It's helpful for the porter to know where you're going so they can organize the bags for your stop. And just like the grocery store, it's **very** important you keep your tags on a safe place to get your stuff back.

>[!Warning] Danger
> Carry your passport on you at all times. The country likes tourists but hates (illegal) immigrants. You will be randomly selected by police to show identification. The only way for them know who you are is if you have your passport, otherwise you'll waste your vacation time in a holding cell until they can ID you, or worse, you risk getting sanctioned and deported.

> [!Warning] Pickpockets
> Pickpockets are a real danger/concern Turkey. Keep your belongings close to you and within your sight at all times.

Hagia Sophia / Aya Sophia - easiest to get in during namaz time. There's a visitor line and a namaz line that opens when the adhan is called. You must dress appropriately to enter regardless of which line you're in. You must be wearing long sleeves, and covering your hair if you're a woman. They sell scarves atm but bring your own to avoid an easily avoidable expense.

### Copper Cooking Utensils
If you buy a traditional copper coffee pot, make sure the inside is lined with something other than copper and that it has a wooden handle that is angled appropriately for you; avoiding handles that are vertical and opting for handles that This is super obvious when you look at it. Unlined copper cooking utensils can be poisonous, especially when used to cook acidic foods. Copper is an extremely good conductor of heat so if the handle is made of copper it will be too hot to touch. A wooden handle solves this and having a more horizontal handle prevents the wooden from getting damaged from the steam.

### Hamam - Turkish Baths
Unlike Yalova, not every bath let's you bring in your own clothes. Some give you bathing clothes. I definitely recommend going to a Hamam and getting scrubbed as well as a massage. Please note, that many Hamams have separate entrances for men and women so I am only able to detail the experience in the men's section. I hope the experience is the same on the women's side. Although some Hamams are mixed baths, so choose according to your taste. 

When you enter the Hamam, you'll be given slippers in exchange for your shoes and shown to a dressing room. Once in the dressing room, you are expected to remove **all** clothes (even your underwear) and put on either your bathing suit or the one provided. Once in your bathing suit, you will either go to a shower station or a bathing hall, the Hamam itself. If the Hamam has a pool, you'll need to wash yourself before entering. Hamams are generally very hot. Balance the heat with adequate cold water to cool off. Next enjoy yourself. Hamams have wonderful hot and cold water, saunas, massages, etc. Soap is not usually provided. There's sometimes a flat hot stone in the Hamam that you should try lying down on.

I definitely recommend getting a scrub and massage. Massages and scrubs are extra but worth it in my opinion. You'll need to wash yourself before seeing the masseuse. They will wash, scrub, soap, and massage you. Turkish massages are rather rough, be warned. Sometimes they slap you or they can scrub too hard. They use a cloth glove to scrub you and while not very abrasive, the firm pressure they apply removes dead skin. Scrubbing and Massages are separate but are usually bundled together. You can skip one or the other. Do not get scrubbed more than once a week or every two weeks otherwise they might do some harm. There might be nothing left to scrub!
Afterwards they'll give you a Turkish Towel aka Peshtemal Havlu to dry off that you return to them. And you can hang out and relax until you're ready to leave. They also serve drinks if you want.
